# Prerequisites for Deployment

This document outlines the prerequisites needed to deploy the Multiplayer Chess Application to a production environment.

## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- **Server**: Virtual or dedicated server with at least:
  - 2 CPU cores
  - 4 GB RAM
  - 20 GB SSD storage
- **Scalability**: For high-traffic implementations, consider a larger server or a clustered deployment

### Operating System

The application can be deployed on:
- **Linux**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later (recommended)
- **Windows Server**: 2019 or later
- **macOS**: Monterey or later (for development environments)

Linux is recommended for production environments due to better performance and resource utilization.

## Software Requirements

### Runtime Environment

- **Node.js**: v18.x or later
  - Installation instructions: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- **npm**: v9.x or later (comes with Node.js)
- **Alternatively**: Use nvm (Node Version Manager) to manage Node.js versions

### Database

- **PostgreSQL**: v14.x or later
  - Installation instructions: [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
  - Minimum 2 GB RAM dedicated to PostgreSQL

### Web Server (Optional, for reverse proxy)

- **Nginx**: v1.20 or later
  - Installation instructions: [https://nginx.org/en/download.html](https://nginx.org/en/download.html)
- **Apache**: v2.4 or later

### SSL Certificate

- Required for secure HTTPS connections
- Options:
  - Let's Encrypt (free)
  - Commercial SSL certificate
  - Self-signed certificate (not recommended for production)

## Network Requirements

### Ports

The following ports need to be open:
- **80/443**: HTTP/HTTPS for web access
- **3000**: Default Next.js port (if not behind a reverse proxy)
- **3001**: WebSocket server port (can be configured)
- **5432**: PostgreSQL port (should only be accessible internally)

### Domain Name

- A registered domain name is required for production deployment
- DNS configuration pointing to your server's IP address

### Firewall Configuration

- Configure your firewall to allow traffic on the necessary ports
- Restrict access to PostgreSQL port (5432) to only internal network or via SSH tunnel

## Authentication Requirements

### Clerk Account

- Create a Clerk account at [https://clerk.dev](https://clerk.dev)
- Set up an application in Clerk dashboard
- Note your API keys (public and secret)

## Monitoring and Logging

- Consider setting up:
  - Server monitoring (e.g., New Relic, Datadog)
  - Log aggregation (e.g., ELK stack, Graylog)
  - Uptime monitoring (e.g., UptimeRobot, Pingdom)

## Backup Solution

- Regular database backups are essential
- Options:
  - PostgreSQL's pg_dump utility
  - Managed backup service
  - Custom backup scripts

## Development Tools (for maintenance)

- Git
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- PostgreSQL client (e.g., pgAdmin, DBeaver)

## Next Steps

After ensuring all prerequisites are met, proceed to the [Environment Setup](environment-setup.md) guide to configure your server for deployment.
