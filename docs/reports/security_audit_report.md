# Security Audit Report: Multiplayer Chess Application

## Executive Summary

This security audit of the multiplayer chess application has identified **12 vulnerabilities** of varying severity, including **4 high/critical** issues that require immediate attention. The audit focused on authentication mechanisms, WebSocket security, API endpoints, data validation, CORS configurations, and potential information leakage.

## Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. Authentication Vulnerabilities (Critical)

**Issue**: WebSocket connections lack proper authentication validation.  
**Location**: `src/server.js:22-33`  
**Details**: The WebSocket server accepts connections with only a userId query parameter without verifying this ID belongs to an authenticated user.

```javascript
// Get userId from connection query parameters
const userId = socket.handshake.query.userId;
if (userId) {
  users.set(userId, socket.id);
  // No validation that this userId is legitimate
}
```

**Remediation**: Implement token-based authentication for WebSocket connections. Require a signed JWT or session token that can be validated server-side.

### 2. CORS Misconfiguration (High)

**Issue**: Permissive CORS settings in WebSocket server  
**Location**: `src/server.js:9-15`  
**Details**: CORS is configured to allow connections from any origin ('*') which enables cross-site attacks.

```javascript
const io = new Server(server, {
  cors: {
    origin: '*', // In production, restrict to your domain
    methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
    credentials: true
  }
});
```

**Remediation**: Restrict CORS to specific trusted domains. Replace the wildcard with your application's domain, especially in production environments.

### 3. Lack of Input Validation (High)

**Issue**: Insufficient validation of game actions and move inputs  
**Location**: `src/services/gameService.ts:334-373`  
**Details**: The makeMove function performs minimal validation before accepting moves, allowing potentially invalid moves to be processed.

**Remediation**: Implement comprehensive validation of all inputs, particularly game moves, user IDs, and game state changes. Validate moves server-side before applying them.

### 4. WebSocket Message Authentication (High)

**Issue**: No validation that users are authorized to perform actions in games  
**Location**: `src/server.js:49-197`  
**Details**: The server accepts game events from any connected client without verifying they are part of the game or authorized to take the specific action.

**Remediation**: Implement authorization checks for each WebSocket message to verify the user is allowed to perform the requested action.

### 5. Game ID Predictability (Medium)

**Issue**: Game IDs are generated using timestamps, making them predictable  
**Location**: `src/services/gameService.ts:129`  
**Details**: Game IDs follow the pattern `game_${Date.now()}`, allowing potential enumeration and targeting of specific games.

```javascript
const gameId = `game_${Date.now()}`;
```

**Remediation**: Use cryptographically secure random values for generating game IDs.

### 6. Information Disclosure in Error Responses (Medium)

**Issue**: Detailed error messages returned to clients  
**Location**: `src/app/api/multiplayer/games/route.ts:32`  
**Details**: Internal error details are exposed in API responses:

```javascript
return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal Server Error', details: error.message }, { status: 500 });
```

**Remediation**: Remove detailed error information from client responses. Log errors server-side and return generic error messages to clients.

### 7. Excessive Logging (Medium)

**Issue**: Sensitive game operations are logged to the console  
**Location**: Various locations in `src/server.js` and `src/services/gameService.ts`  
**Details**: Numerous console.log statements output sensitive information:

```javascript
console.log('Client connected:', socket.id);
console.log(`User ${userId} connected with socket ${socket.id}`);
```

**Remediation**: Remove or redact sensitive information from logs. Implement proper log levels for different environments.

### 8. Lack of Rate Limiting (Medium)

**Issue**: No rate limiting for connections or API calls  
**Location**: `src/server.js` and API endpoints  
**Details**: The application doesn't implement rate limiting, allowing potential DoS attacks.

**Remediation**: Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints and WebSocket connections.

### 9. Client-Side Authentication Reliance (Low)

**Issue**: Game logic depends on client-side authentication checks  
**Location**: `src/app/multiplayer/game/[gameId]/page.tsx:161-196`  
**Details**: Game move validation relies partly on client-side authentication state.

**Remediation**: Move all critical game logic to the server and treat client-side states as untrusted.

### 10. Insecure WebSocket URL (Low)

**Issue**: Hardcoded WebSocket server URL without TLS  
**Location**: `src/services/gameService.ts:98`  
**Details**: WebSocket connection uses unencrypted connection:

```javascript
socket = io('http://localhost:3001', {
  query: { userId },
  autoConnect: true,
  reconnection: true,
});
```

**Remediation**: Use environment variables for WebSocket URLs and ensure TLS (wss://) in production.

### 11. Missing CSRF Protection (Low)

**Issue**: No explicit CSRF protection for API endpoints  
**Location**: API routes  
**Details**: While Next.js provides some built-in protection, there's no explicit CSRF token validation.

**Remediation**: Implement CSRF tokens for sensitive operations.

### 12. Missing Content Security Policy (Low)

**Issue**: No Content Security Policy configured  
**Location**: Application-wide  
**Details**: The application lacks CSP headers to protect against XSS attacks.

**Remediation**: Implement appropriate Content Security Policy headers to restrict script sources.

## Recommendations Summary

1. **Critical Fixes**:
   - Implement token-based authentication for WebSocket connections
   - Restrict CORS settings to specific trusted domains
   - Add server-side validation for all game actions
   - Verify user authorization for each WebSocket message

2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Use cryptographically secure random values for IDs
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Remove detailed error information from client responses
   - Ensure all connections use TLS in production

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Implement proper logging with appropriate levels
   - Add CSRF protection for sensitive operations
   - Configure Content Security Policy headers
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

## Conclusion

The multiplayer chess application has significant security vulnerabilities that could compromise user accounts, game integrity, and potentially lead to unauthorized access. The most critical issues revolve around WebSocket authentication and message validation. Addressing these vulnerabilities, particularly the high/critical ones, should be prioritized before deploying this application to production.
