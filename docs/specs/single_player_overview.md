## 3. Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
1. **StockfishService (src/services/stockfishService.ts)**
   - Core service for interfacing with the Stockfish chess engine
   - Provides move calculation, hint, and analysis functionality
   - Implements fallback mock engine for testing and reliability
   - Handles caching and optimization of engine operations

2. **Setup UI (src/app/single-player/page.tsx)**
   - Renders game configuration options
   - Handles user preferences for:
     - Difficulty level
     - Player color
     - Feature enablement (hints, analysis)
   - Manages navigation to the game board with selected options

3. **Game Board UI (src/app/single-player/game/page.tsx)**
   - Renders the interactive chessboard
   - Manages game state and turn handling
   - Processes user interactions and move validation
   - Displays game status and controls
   - Implements specialized components:
     - ChessSquare (for board rendering)
     - SavedGamesModal (for loading saved games)
     - GameControls (for game management)
     - AssistancePanel (for hints and analysis)

### Key Services and Responsibilities

**StockfishService:**
- Initialize and configure the chess engine
- Calculate optimal moves based on current position
- Provide move suggestions (hints)
- Analyze positions with evaluations
- Handle errors and fallbacks
- Manage engine resources

**Chess.js Library:**
- Enforce chess rules and validate moves
- Track game state and history
- Detect special conditions (check, checkmate, etc.)
- Generate legal moves for selected pieces

### Data Flow and State Management
1. **Game Initialization Flow:**
   - User selects game options in the setup UI
   - Options are passed as URL parameters to the game board component
   - Game board initializes Chess.js instance with starting position
   - StockfishService is initialized with the selected difficulty
   - If player is black, computer makes the first move

2. **Move Execution Flow:**
   - Player selects a piece, legal moves are displayed
   - Player selects destination square for the move
   - Move is validated and executed
   - Game state is updated
   - Computer's turn is triggered
   - StockfishService calculates and executes computer's move
   - Game state is updated again

3. **State Management:**
   - Core game state maintained in React state hooks
   - Chess position managed by Chess.js instance
   - UI selection state (selected pieces, legal moves) in local state
   - Saved games stored in browser's localStorage

### Integration with Stockfish Chess Engine
- Dynamic import of Stockfish with fallback mechanism
- Configuration of engine parameters based on difficulty
- Communication via message passing
- Position representation using Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN)
- Move representation using Universal Chess Interface (UCI) format
- Caching of calculated moves and analysis for performance
- Proper cleanup and resource management

### Performance Considerations
- Memoization of components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Caching of engine calculations for common positions
- Optimized rendering of chessboard using React.memo
- Adaptive engine search depth based on difficulty
- Error boundaries to prevent component failures
- Cleanup of resources on component unmount

## 4. User Interface Requirements

### Game Setup Screen
- Clear title and instructions
- Difficulty selection with three options (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Color selection with visual representations (White/Black)
