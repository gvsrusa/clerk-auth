# Feature Overview: Multiplayer Chess

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the specifications for the multiplayer feature of the web-based chess application. The multiplayer mode will allow registered users to play chess against each other in real-time, fostering an engaging and competitive environment. This feature leverages Clerk for user authentication and will require a WebSocket-based solution for real-time communication.

## 2. User Stories
*   **US1:** As a registered user, I want to create a new multiplayer game so that I can play with a friend or an open opponent.
*   **US2:** As a registered user, I want to see a list of available public games to join so that I can play against other users.
*   **US3:** As a registered user, I want to join an existing open public game so that I can start playing immediately.
*   **US4:** As a registered user, I want to be notified (visually and/or audibly) when it's my turn to make a move so that I don't miss my turn.
*   **US5:** As a player, I want to see my opponent's moves reflected on my board in real-time (within a few seconds) so that the game feels interactive.
*   **US6:** As a player, I want to be able to offer a draw to my opponent so that the game can end amicably if neither player has an advantage or if we agree.
*   **US7:** As a player, I want to be able to accept or decline a draw offer from my opponent so that I have control over the game's outcome.
*   **US8:** As a player, I want to be able to resign from a game so that I can concede if I believe I will lose or cannot continue.
*   **US9:** As a player, I want to see the current game status clearly displayed (e.g., check, checkmate, stalemate, draw, whose turn) so that I understand the state of the game.
*   **US10:** As a registered user, I want to view my past multiplayer game history (opponents, results) so that I can review my performance.
*   **US11:** As a registered user, I want to invite a specific friend (another registered user identified by username) to a private game so that I can play exclusively with people I know.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria
*   **AC1 (US1):** A registered user can successfully create a new game (public or private). If public, it appears in a list of available games. If private, a unique game identifier/link is available for sharing or an invitation is sent.
*   **AC2 (US2):** A registered user can view a filterable/sortable list of public games created by other users that are open to join, showing relevant details (e.g., creator, time since creation).
*   **AC3 (US3):** A registered user can click a "Join" button on a public game and be successfully added as the opponent, initiating the game.
*   **AC4 (US4):** The user whose turn it is receives a clear visual notification on the game screen, and an optional subtle sound notification if the window is active.
*   **AC5 (US5):** When an opponent makes a move, the move is visually updated on the user's board within 2 seconds under normal network conditions.
*   **AC6 (US6):** A user can click an "Offer Draw" button. The opponent receives a clear, non-intrusive notification of the draw offer. The game continues until the offer is responded to or withdrawn (withdrawal is optional).
*   **AC7 (US7):** An opponent who has received a draw offer can click "Accept Draw" or "Decline Draw". If accepted, the game ends in a draw. If declined, the game continues.
*   **AC8 (US8):** A user can click a "Resign" button. The game immediately ends, and the resigning user is marked as the loser, the opponent as the winner.
*   **AC9 (US9):** The UI accurately and prominently displays game states: "White's Turn", "Black's Turn", "Check!", "Checkmate - White Wins", "Checkmate - Black Wins", "Stalemate - Draw", "Draw by Agreement", "Draw by Resignation (White/Black resigned)".
*   **AC10 (US10):** A registered user can access a dedicated section showing a list of their completed multiplayer games, including opponent, their color, game result, and date.
*   **AC11 (US11):** A user can initiate a game by inviting another known registered user (e.g., by username). The invited user receives a notification and can accept or decline the invitation. If accepted, a private game starts between them.

## 4. Functional Requirements
*   **FR1:** User Authentication: Users must be authenticated via Clerk to access multiplayer features.
*   **FR2:** Game Creation: Ability to create public games (open to anyone) or private games (invite-only).
*   **FR3:** Game Lobby/Discovery: A system for users to find and join available public games.
*   **FR4:** Real-time Move Synchronization: Opponent's moves must be transmitted and displayed using WebSockets.
*   **FR5:** Turn Management: The system must accurately track and indicate whose turn it is.
*   **FR6:** Game State Logic: Implementation of all standard chess rules, including move validation, check, checkmate, stalemate detection (leveraging `chess.js`).
*   **FR7:** Draw Offers: Mechanism for players to offer, accept, or decline draws.
*   **FR8:** Resignation: Mechanism for players to resign from a game.
*   **FR9:** Game History: Storage and retrieval of completed multiplayer game records for each user.
*   **FR10:** Invitation System: Ability for users to invite specific other registered users to a game.
*   **FR11:** Connection Handling: Basic handling for disconnections (e.g., opponent disconnected message, game might be forfeit after a timeout or allow reconnection within a short window - TBD).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
*   **NFR1: Performance:** Move transmission and board updates should occur with latency < 2 seconds. Lobby loading should be quick.
*   **NFR2: Scalability:** The system architecture should support at least 100 concurrent active games initially, with a path to scale further.
*   **NFR3: Reliability:** Game state must be persisted robustly. Minimize chances of game state corruption due to server or client issues. Reconnection to ongoing games should be supported if feasible.
*   **NFR4: Security:** All communication, especially game moves and user actions, must be secure. Authentication handled by Clerk. No unauthorized game manipulation.
*   **NFR5: Usability:** The interface for creating, joining, and playing games must be intuitive and user-friendly. Notifications should be clear and non-obtrusive.

## 6. Scope
### In-Scope (for initial MVP):
*   1v1 multiplayer chess games between two registered users.
*   Real-time move synchronization.
*   Game creation (public and private invite-based).
*   Lobby for public games.
*   Standard game controls: making moves, offering draw, accepting/declining draw, resigning.
*   Basic turn notifications within the game UI.
*   Enforcement of standard chess rules.
*   Display of game status (check, checkmate, stalemate, turn).
*   User-to-user invitation for private games.
*   Viewing personal multiplayer game history (list of games, opponents, results).

### Out-of-Scope (for initial MVP, potential future enhancements):
*   Player ratings, ELO system, or leaderboards.
*   Tournament modes or organized play events.
*   Spectator mode for ongoing games.
*   In-game chat functionality (text or voice).
*   Advanced time controls (e.g., blitz, rapid, classical with increments). Default to untimed or a single simple time control.
*   Rematch functionality directly after a game ends.
*   Analysis board post-game.
*   Guest play (non-registered users).
*   Notifications outside the application (e.g., email, push).

## 7. Dependencies
### Internal:
*   **User Authentication System:** Clerk (existing integration).
*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (project stack).
*   **Chess Logic Library:** `chess.js` (for move validation, game state).
*   **UI Components:** To be built using Next.js/React.

### External/Services:
*   **WebSocket Server/Service:** Required for real-time communication. (Currently a "stub", needs implementation or selection of a managed service).
*   **Database:** For storing user game history, active game states (if not fully in-memory with WebSocket state).

## 8. UI/UX Considerations
*   **Clarity:** Clear visual indication of whose turn it is, game status, and opponent's last move.
*   **Responsiveness:** Board interactions and move feedback should feel immediate.
*   **Notifications:** Game invites, turn changes, draw offers, and game end states should be communicated clearly and promptly without being overly intrusive.
*   **Lobby/Game List:** Easy to scan and join public games. Clear distinction between public and private games.
*   **Invitation Flow:** Intuitive process for sending and receiving game invitations.
*   **Error Handling:** Graceful display of errors (e.g., network issues, invalid moves though `chess.js` should prevent most).

## 9. High-Level API/WebSocket Events
*(Illustrative, actual event names and payloads TBD)*

### Client -> Server:
*   `user:authenticate { token }` (handled by Clerk session, WebSocket connection might need auth handshake)
*   `game:create { isPrivate: boolean, invitedUserId?: string }`
*   `game:join { gameId: string }`
*   `game:move { gameId: string, move: { from: string, to: string, promotion?: string } }` (using SAN or from/to)
*   `game:offerDraw { gameId: string }`
*   `game:respondDraw { gameId: string, accepted: boolean }`
*   `game:resign { gameId: string }`
*   `user:inviteToGame { targetUserId: string }` (could also be part of `game:create`)

### Server -> Client(s) (broadcast to game participants or specific users):
*   `game:created { gameId: string, gameState: object, players: object[], isPrivate: boolean }`
*   `game:playerJoined { gameId: string, userId: string, gameState: object }`
*   `game:updated { gameId: string, gameState: object, lastMove: object, currentPlayer: string }` (after a valid move)
*   `game:drawOffered { gameId: string, offeringUserId: string }`
*   `game:drawResponded { gameId: string, respondingUserId: string, accepted: boolean, gameState: object }`
*   `game:ended { gameId: string, reason: string (checkmate | stalemate | resign | draw_agreed), winner?: string, gameState: object }`
*   `user:invitedToGame { gameId: string, invitingUserName: string }`
*   `error:general { message: string, details?: object }`
*   `lobby:gamesListUpdated { games: object[] }` (for users in the lobby)
