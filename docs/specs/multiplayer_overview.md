### Data Flow and State Management

1. **Game Creation Flow:**
   - User selects game type (public/private) in lobby
   - For private games, the user enters invitee username
   - GameService creates a new game with the creator as white
   - The game is stored and broadcast to the lobby (if public)
   - For private games, an invitation is sent to the invitee
   - Creator is redirected to the game page to wait for opponent

2. **Game Joining Flow:**
   - User views available public games in lobby
   - User selects a game to join
   - GameService adds the user as black to the selected game
   - The game state is updated to 'active'
   - Both players are synchronized to the game page
   - The initial chess board is displayed to both players

3. **Move Execution Flow:**
   - Current player selects a piece, legal moves are displayed
   - Player selects destination square for the move
   - Move is validated and sent to the server
   - Server verifies the move and updates game state
   - Updated game state is broadcast to both players
   - Next player's turn is activated
   - Game checks for special conditions (check, checkmate, etc.)

4. **Draw Offer Flow:**
   - Player sends draw offer via UI
   - Server records offer and notifies opponent
   - Opponent receives notification and responds (accept/decline)
   - If accepted, game ends as a draw and is recorded in history
   - If declined, game continues and offer is cleared

5. **Resignation Flow:**
   - Player selects resign option
   - Confirmation is requested and provided
   - Server records resignation and updates game state
   - Both players are notified of the outcome
   - Game ends with the opponent as winner
   - Result is recorded in game history

6. **State Management:**
