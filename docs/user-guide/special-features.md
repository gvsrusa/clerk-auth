# Special Features

This guide explains the special features available in multiplayer chess games, including draw offers, resignations, and accessing game history.

## Draw Offers

A draw is a game outcome where neither player wins or loses. Players can offer and respond to draw offers during a game.

### Offering a Draw

To offer a draw to your opponent:

1. During your turn or your opponent's turn, locate the "Offer Draw" button in the game controls
2. Click the "Offer Draw" button
3. A confirmation dialog will appear asking if you're sure you want to offer a draw
4. Click "Confirm" to send the draw offer
5. Your opponent will receive a notification about your draw offer
6. The game continues while your opponent considers your offer

### Responding to a Draw Offer

When your opponent offers a draw:

1. You will see a notification indicating that your opponent has offered a draw
2. Two buttons will appear: "Accept Draw" and "Decline Draw"
3. Click "Accept Draw" if you agree to end the game as a draw
   - The game will immediately end with a "Draw by Agreement" result
   - Both players' records will show a draw for this game
4. Click "Decline Draw" if you want to continue playing
   - The offer will be removed
   - The game will continue normally

### Draw Offer Etiquette

- Don't spam draw offers as it can be distracting to your opponent
- Consider offering a draw in positions where:
  - The position is clearly balanced
  - A repetition of position has occurred
  - Neither player has a clear path to victory
- A declined draw offer cannot be offered again for at least 5 moves

## Resignations

Resignation is when a player concedes defeat before being checkmated.

### Resigning a Game

To resign a game:

1. Locate the "Resign" button in the game controls
2. Click the "Resign" button
3. A confirmation dialog will appear asking if you're sure you want to resign
4. Click "Confirm" to resign the game
5. The game will immediately end
6. Your opponent will be declared the winner
7. Your game record will show a loss for this game

### Resignation Etiquette

- Resigning is a respectful way to concede a lost position without forcing your opponent to play out a won game
- Consider resigning when:
  - You are in a clearly lost position with no reasonable chance of recovery
  - You are significantly behind in material with no compensation
  - You need to leave and cannot continue the game
