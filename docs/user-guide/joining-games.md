# Joining Games

This guide explains how to join existing multiplayer chess games, including both public games and private games by invitation.

## Joining Public Games

Public games are visible to all users and can be joined without an invitation:

1. Log in to your account and navigate to the multiplayer lobby
2. Browse the list of available public games
3. Each public game listing displays:
   - The creator's username
   - When the game was created
   - A "Join" button
4. Click the "Join" button on the game you wish to join
5. You will be automatically assigned the black pieces
6. The game will start immediately, and you will be taken to the game board

## Responding to Game Invitations

For private games, you'll need to respond to an invitation:

1. When someone invites you to a private game, you'll receive a notification
2. The notification will appear in your notifications panel (bell icon in the header)
3. You can also see pending invitations in the "Game Invitations" section of the multiplayer lobby
4. For each invitation, you'll see:
   - Who sent the invitation
   - When it was sent
   - "Accept" and "Decline" buttons
5. Click "Accept" to join the game or "Decline" to reject the invitation
6. If you accept, the game will start immediately, and you'll be taken to the game board

## Finding Specific Games

If you're looking for a specific game or type of game:

1. Use the filters in the lobby to narrow down the available games:
   - Sort by: Newest, Oldest
   - Filter by: Creator username
2. If someone has shared a game ID with you directly, you can use the "Join by ID" option:
   - Click on "Join by ID" button in the lobby
   - Enter the game ID you received
   - Click "Join" to enter the game
