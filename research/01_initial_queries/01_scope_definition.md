# Chess Application Scope Definition

## Project Overview
The Chess Application is a fully implemented web-based chess platform that offers both single-player and multiplayer capabilities, built with Next.js and featuring secure authentication via Clerk. This comprehensive scope definition outlines the boundaries and primary objectives of our research analysis.

## Core Functionality Scope

### Single-Player Functionality
- **AI Opponent Integration**: The application integrates the Stockfish chess engine to provide computer opponents with adjustable difficulty levels.
- **Game Customization**: Players can choose to play as white or black pieces, with various additional options.
- **Assistance Features**: The single-player mode includes advanced features such as hints and position analysis.
- **Game Management**: Players can undo moves, save/load games, and start new games.

### Multiplayer Functionality
- **Real-time Gameplay**: The application provides real-time chess gameplay between two human opponents.
- **Authentication**: User authentication is implemented using the Clerk authentication service.
- **Game Lobbies**: The application includes functionality for creating and joining public or private games.
- **Game History**: Players can access and review past games.
- **Advanced Features**: The multiplayer mode includes special features such as draw offers, resignations, move validation, and turn notifications.

### Technical Architecture Scope
- **Frontend**: Next.js React-based UI with server-side rendering
- **Backend**: Socket.IO server for real-time communication
- **AI Integration**: Stockfish chess engine integration for single-player mode
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database for game state persistence
- **Authentication**: Clerk authentication implementation
- **Security**: Comprehensive security implementations including WebSocket authentication and proper input validation

## Research Focus Areas
Our research analysis will focus on the following key aspects:

1. **Architecture Assessment**: Evaluation of the current architectural design and implementation, focusing on component relationships and system boundaries.

2. **Technology Stack Evaluation**: Analysis of the selected technologies and their effectiveness in meeting project requirements.

3. **Feature Implementation Review**: Detailed review of key features implemented in both single-player and multiplayer modes.

4. **Security Implementation Analysis**: Assessment of security measures implemented, particularly in authentication and WebSocket connections.

5. **Performance Optimization Review**: Analysis of performance optimizations implemented and their effectiveness.

6. **Code Organization and Quality**: Assessment of project structure, code quality, and adherence to best practices.

7. **Testing Coverage**: Analysis of the testing approach and coverage across different parts of the application.

## Out of Scope
The following areas are considered out of scope for this research analysis:

- Implementation of new features or functionality
- Actual deployment of the application to production environments
- Business model or monetization strategies
- Detailed user experience (UX) design evaluations
- Extensive performance benchmarking or load testing

## Research Objectives
The primary objectives of this research analysis are to:

1. Document the current implementation comprehensively
2. Identify strengths in the current implementation
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of technology choices
4. Assess potential areas for improvement
5. Provide recommendations for maintainability and future development

This research will serve as a formal documentation of the project implementation, focusing on technical architecture, code structure, security implementation, and overall development approach.
